The PyTorch OSPO & Academic Outreach Program is an initiative connecting PyTorch with academia through research reproducibility and responsible OSAI practices. It’s an effort to strengthen collaboration between the PyTorch community, Academic Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), and AI research centers. This program aims to:

- Empower educators and students to adopt open source AI tools and best practices in their courses and research studies
- Support academic OSPOs in integrating PyTorch into educational programs and institutional research workflows
- Educate on reproducible and transparent research aligned with the open source principles that drive PyTorch

## What are the deliverables?

- Webinar Series for Academia: Recordings focused on PyTorch fundamentals for academic research and transfer knowledge and open source AI best practices. Starting January 2026
- Hands-on teaching materials: lecture slides and notebooks with exercises

# For Contributors

## Who can contribute?

We’re calling on subject matter experts in PyTorch and the academic research community who are:
